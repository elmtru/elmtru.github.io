The name is from Neo-Latin molybdaenum, from Ancient Greek Μόλυβδος molybdos, meaning lead, since its ores were confused with lead ores. Molybdenum minerals have been known throughout history, but the element was discovered (in the sense of differentiating it as a new entity from the mineral salts of other metals) in 1778 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele.","Mo",[16,17,18,19,20],2,8,18,13,1,"1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d10 4p6 5s1 4d5","[Kr] 4d5 5s1",72.1,2.16,[26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55],684.3,1560,2618,4480,5257,6640.8,12125,13860,15835,17980,20190,22219,26930,29196,52490,55000,61400,67700,74000,80400,87000,93400,98420,104400,121900,127700,133800,139800,148100,154500,"54b5b5",6,54,false,true,7.0924,2890.15,4912,20,1778,0.251,1.54],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
